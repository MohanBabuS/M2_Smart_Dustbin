# INTRODUCTION
   Smart Dustbin, as its name suggests, functions intelligently or can be described as an automatic dustbin. It works like this: when you walk up to this dustbin, it will automatically open thanks to a servo motor. As a result, some sensor work is required to detect the object in front of the trash can.
# OBJECTIVE
   To design and develop a prototype for an automated open dustbin that can open the lid automatically when it recognises persons who wish to throw rubbish out. It can also detect the amount of trash within the dustbin.
# COMPONENTS REQUIRED
   * ATMEGA328
   * ULTRA SONIC SENSOR
   * SERVO MOTOR
   * DUSTBIN
# WORKING PRINCIPLE
   When the signal is received, the trashcan automatically opens and closes its hatch. A level measuring ultrasonic sensor is also included in the dustbin, which continuously measures the amount of waste in the bin and automatically identifies when it is about to fill up.
# ADVANTAGE
  * The "smart bin" provides information about fill levels and guarantees that the trash is only collected when it is completely filled.
  * Fewer collection visits mean less traffic congestion and disruption, as well as cleaner and safer streets.
# DISADVANTAGE
  * As the city's population grows, the system will require more garbage bins for separate waste collection.
  * The memory size of the sensor nodes utilised in the dustbins is restricted.
