# INTRODUCTION
   Smart Dustbin, as its name suggests, functions intelligently or can be described as an automatic dustbin. It works like this: when you walk up to this dustbin, it will automatically open thanks to a servo motor. As a result, some sensor work is required to detect the object in front of the trash can.
# OBJECTIVE
   To design and develop a prototype for an automated open dustbin that can open the lid automatically when it recognises persons who wish to throw rubbish out. It can also detect the amount of trash within the dustbin.
# COMPONENTS REQUIRED
   * ATMEGA328
   * ULTRA SONIC SENSOR
   * SERVO MOTOR
   * DUSTBIN
# CATEGORY
  * An automatic open-close lid for convenience and to reduce physical contact, preventing the spread of germs.
  * Separation of dry and wet waste
## DESCRIPTION
# ATMEGA328
 * Microchip's ATmega328 is an 8-bit, 28-pin AVR Microcontroller that uses RISC architecture and includes a 32KB flash-type programme memory.
 * The Atmega328 microcontroller is found in the Arduino UNO, Arduino Pro Mini, and Arduino Nano boards.
 * It can function at voltages ranging from 3.3 to 5.5 volts, but we usually choose 5 volts as a standard.
 * Cost-effectiveness, low power consumption, programming lock for security, and true timer counter with independent oscillator are only a few of its outstanding qualities.
 * It's most commonly found in Embedded Systems. Take a look at these Real-Life Embedded System Examples; we can design all of them with this Microcontroller.
# ULTRASONIC SENSOR
  Devices that create or sense ultrasound energy are known as ultrasonic transducers and ultrasonic sensors. Transmitters, receivers, and transceivers are the three broad categories they fall under. Transceivers can both transmit and receive ultrasound, whereas transmitters turn electrical signals into ultrasound.
# SERVO MOTOR
  A servo system comprises of an actuator (muscle), a control device (brain), and a feedback element in its most basic form (the senses). While the muscle can be a variety of mechanisms in the automation sector, it is most frequently represented by a servo motor. The brain can be represented by a number of different parts, although it is most commonly a motion controller or servo drive. A current sensor and/or an encoder, resolver, or even a vision system deliver feedback information to the brain.
  When the control device instructs the actuator to move to a given point, the actuator begins to move, and the feedback device informs the controller of where the actuator is travelling and how quickly it is moving.
# WORKING PRINCIPLE
   After wiring and connecting all of the devices and connecting them to the Smart Dustbin, double-check all of the necessary setups to see if anything is missing. Following the connection setup, the next step is to submit/upload code to the microcontroller and power up the circuit. When the system is turned on, the Atmega328 Controller keeps an eye out for anything that comes within a certain range of the sensor. When an Ultrasonic sensor detects an object, such as a hand or other, the MicroController evaluates its distance and if it is less than a certain value, the servo motor is activated first, with the help of the extended arm of the lid. The lid will open for a set period of time before closing on its own.
# ADVANTAGE
  * The "smart bin" provides information about fill levels and guarantees that the trash is only collected when it is completely filled.
  * Fewer collection visits mean less traffic congestion and disruption, as well as cleaner and safer streets.
# DISADVANTAGE
  * As the city's population grows, the system will require more garbage bins for separate waste collection.
  * The memory size of the sensor nodes utilised in the dustbins is restricted.

# WHAT IS SMART DUSTBIN
 The smart dustbin is a well-designed solution that addresses the social issue of garbage disposal. It recognises the type of material put within it and categorises it as biodegradable or non-biodegradable. As an added incentive to discard waste, the dustbin has the option of providing wifi.
# WHY SMART DUSTBIN
 Smart Bins contribute to a cleaner, safer, and more sanitary environment, as well as improved operating efficiency, while lowering management costs, resources, and roadside emissions.
# WHERE SMART DUSTBIN
 They are frequently used to collect waste in houses, offices, streets, and parks, among other places. Littering is a significant crime in some areas, thus public waste containers are the sole means to dispose of minor waste. Separate bins for collecting wet and dry waste, recyclable and non-recyclable waste are usually used.
# WHEN THE SMART DUSTBIN
 The start-up created the first smart and connected trashcan in 2013, which was totally designed and manufactured in France. The creators of GreenCREATIVE, Lucile Noury and RÃ©mi Gomez
## SWOT ANALYSIS
# STRENGTH
 * Innovation
 * Patnership with eco-friendly companies
 * Incentive to recycle more waste
# WEAKNESS
 * Numerous shakeholder to deal with city council,Syctom etc...
 * Only a service we don't manage the product
 * Values of eco-chain
# OPPORTUNITIES
 * Spreading the movement one city at the time
 * Sorting conciousness
 * Improving the result of existing recycle
# THREAT
 * Is won't patented
 * Win public market bidding
